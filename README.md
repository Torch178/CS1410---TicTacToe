# CS1410---TicTacToe

A simple tic tac toe program in which two users (or one user playing by themself) take turns putting X's and O's into spots on a 3x3 grid. They do this by entering a number corresponding to a place in the grid. When one user manages to get three of their letter in a row on the grid they win, otherwise the other user wins, or it ends in a draw. Users can not put an X or and O where there already is one. If the user tries, the game proceeds, effectively skipping their turn.


The program was created as a project in the Code::Blocks IDE.
